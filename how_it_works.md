#This is a basic implementation of a music player application inspired by cmus. Right now it works, but I want your help extending it.

"""
This code sets up a basic music player application that can load and play MP3 files in the specified directory. 
Please improve it by adding a command-line interface that allows for features such as skipping to the next or previous song, pausing and resuming playback.


To extend the `MusicPlayer` class to be more feature-rich, you can add the following methods:

  * `play_song`: This method plays the specified MP3 file in the specified directory.
  
  * `stop_play`: This method stops playing the specified MP3 file in the specified directory.

  * `play_all_songs`: This method plays all the songs that have been added to the list of currently played songs.

These methods will allow for additional features.


**Explanation and Additional Considerations:**

1. **`MusicPlayer` Class:**
   * The class is structured for handling music files and playback actions.

2. **`load_songs()` Method:** 
   * Uses `os.walk()` to traverse through the specified music directory (replace with your actual music folder) and loads MP3 files into a list of song paths.  
   * Handles potential errors gracefully using try-except blocks.

3. **Command-Line Interface (`ui` method):**
   * Provides interactive command line for switching songs:
       * `n`: Moves to next song (default behavior).
       * `p`: Moves to previous song (default behavior). 

4. **Playback Methods:** 
    *  `play_song()` and `pause_playback()`, and `resume_playback()` - Implement these methods using the appropriate libraries or code logic for controlling playback in your environment. 

**How it Works:**
1. The `MusicPlayer` class initializes itself with the specified music directory.
2. **Loading Songs:** The `load_songs()` method reads all files (MP3s, etc.) from the given directory. 
3.  **Command-Line Interface (`ui`):** The user can interact with the program using commands like 'n' and 'p'.

5. **Play/Pause Functions:**  The code now includes placeholder functions for `pause_playback`, `resume_playback`, and `stop_playback`.  You can implement your preferred method for these functions, depending on the framework you're working with (e.g., simple commands in a terminal or more advanced audio playback libraries).

6. * **More Robust Controls:** For a complete Music Player application, consider adding buttons or controls for:
    * **Volume Control:**  Allow users to adjust the volume using sliders or buttons.
    * **Playback Speed:**  Give users the ability to change the playback speed (e.g., 0.5x, 1.5x)
    * **Playlist Management:** Create playlists from songs you have loaded and manage them. 

    **Key Libraries for Advanced Controls:**

    * **PyAudio**: A low-level audio library that gives you fine-grained control over audio input and output.
    * **Librosa**:  A powerful Python library with tools for analyzing and processing audio (e.g., to get time stamps of the audio).

**Important Notes:**

* **Replace placeholder:** Remember to replace placeholders like "Music/Ariana Grande - thank u, next (2019) [320]" with your actual music directory path.  
* **Error Handling:** The code includes basic error handling for loading the music files. You might want to add more robust error handling if you need it. 


Let me know if you have specific playback functions in mind, or would like help adding them!
